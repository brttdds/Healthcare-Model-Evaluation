# healthcare-analytics
Using a healthcare dataset (Excel) that included 350,000+ diagnosis predictions and 4,000+ diagnosis descriptions, I set up a local PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin, used SQL to explore the predictive performance of the two models, and created a one-slide visualization.

Tools used:
Excel, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin 4, SQL, ChatGPT, PowerPoint.

Key Insight: 
By analyzing COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) diagnoses across three prediction confidence thresholds (0.5, 0.7, 0.9), I found that Model 2 consistently outperforms Model 1, achieving 100% confirmation accuracy at 0.7.

Note:
Due to privacy restrictions, the original healthcare dataset cannot be shared. A small mock dataset is included for demonstration purposes only.
