# healthcare-analytics
This was a technical take-home exercise with a dataset that included 350,000+ diagnosis predictions and 4,000+ diagnosis descriptions. I set up a local PostgreSQL database for querying using pgAdmin, explored the predictive performance of two models, and created a one-slide visualization.

Tools used:
Excel, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin 4, SQL (complex joins, filters, aggregations), ChatGPT, PowerPoint.

Key Insight: 
I focused on evaluating model accuracy at high-confidence thresholds to identify areas for improving prediction reliability.

Note:
Due to privacy concerns, the actual healthcare dataset used in this analysis cannot be shared. Instead, a small mock dataset is provided.
