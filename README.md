# healthcare-analytics
This was a technical take-home exercise with a dataset that included 350,000+ diagnosis predictions and 4,000+ diagnosis descriptions. I set up a local PostgreSQL database for querying using pgAdmin, explored the predictive performance of two models, and created a one-slide insight summary for presentation.

Tools used:

Excel
PostgreSQL / pgAdmin 4
SQL (complex joins, filters, aggregations)
ChatGPT
PowerPoint

Key Insight: I focused on evaluating model accuracy at high-confidence thresholds to identify actionable areas for improving prediction reliability.

Note:
Due to privacy concerns, the actual healthcare dataset used in this analysis cannot be shared. The code and queries here are based on a similar schema using mock data.
